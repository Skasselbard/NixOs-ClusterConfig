# Examples

In this folder are some example configurations.
Common configurations like NixOs configurations, ssh keys and other secrets are stored in the [Common Configuration Folder](./00-exampleConfigs/).
Since these examples should be reproducible, the configurations (especially the secrets) are openly readable.
If you adapt the settings you should limit the access to some of the configuration, especially the attributs and files from the [Secrets Folder](./00-exampleConfigs/secrets/).

The examples may extend previous example.
If so, the concepts and configuration may not be repeated in detail.
