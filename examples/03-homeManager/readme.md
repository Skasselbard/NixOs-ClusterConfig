## Objective


## Prerequisites

- Three virtual machines you can deploy to.
  - You may have to change the NixOs configuration in [Configs Folder](../00-exampleConfigs/).
- Reuse the deployed machines from the [Simple Cluster Example](../01-simpleCluster/)
  - Otherwise you need to build the ISOs again and boot from them initially
- Add the SSH private key from the [Config Folder](../00-exampleConfigs/secrets/sshKey) to your [SSH Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent)
